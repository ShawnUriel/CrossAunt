                <h2>Who is Cross-Aunt?</h2>
                <p>
                    Rosita R. Sunga, also known as "Auntie Rose," is the heart behind the brand "CrossAunt." A 70-year-old baker, she has been baking for over 40 years. She started baking as a hobby, originally making treats just for her grandchildren. Her kitchen holds some of the most heartfelt memories, which is why every loaf of bread she bakes is filled with her love for the craft.

                <h2>What do we believe in?</h2>
                <p>
                    CrossAunt aims to serve the freshest bread and pastries in town. We believe that every bake tells a story, and every bite feels like home. Our customers always come first, and we ensure that they enjoy the taste of life in their kitchen. Ten percent of our sales goes to donation projects, and at the end of each week, we give away any available bread and pastries to those in need.

                <h2>What Do We Offer</h2>
                <p>
                    We offer a variety of bread and pastries, but since croissants are our most sought-after item, we provide a range of flavors and allow customers to place their orders in advance for same-day delivery within NCR, fresh from the oven. We also offer catering services for parties. Simply contact us on our social media or email us at crossaunt@gmail.com.
